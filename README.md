# cinenymizer
A silly gizmo that synonomizes movie titles (or any other text to be fair) for the sake of hilarity.

## CLI-based fun for the whole family! ##

Open through Git Bash (probably works with other CLIs, who knows) to engage in a battle of linguistic prowess against an unfeeling machine.

Optionally provide a text of your own as a parameter to confound yourself and others with the grammatical nonsense that will inevitably ensue.

*Example:* `php index.php "The Lord of the Rings"` â†’ `"The Patriarch of the Lassos"`
